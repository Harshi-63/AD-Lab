      "* **DePaul School, Berhampur (2020):** Completed 10th grade (ICSE) with 92.4%.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Overall:** Angelina's resume showcases a diverse skill set encompassing web development, data science, and deep learning.  Her project experience demonstrates practical application of these skills, and her leadership role highlights her initiative. The resume could be improved by quantifying project impacts and providing more context around the work experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Resume Strengths ---\n",
      " The resume has some good foundational elements, but needs significant restructuring and improvement in clarity and conciseness.  Here's a breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Strengths:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Strong Technical Skills:** Angelina lists a comprehensive range of in-demand skills across various domains like web development, data science, and DevOps.  This breadth can be attractive for different roles.\n",
      "* **Project Portfolio:**  She includes several projects that demonstrate practical application of her technical skills. The project titles are generally descriptive, and she lists the technologies used for each.\n",
      "* **Academic Excellence:**  Her high CGPA and secondary school scores indicate a strong academic background.\n",
      "* **Leadership Experience:** Leading the app development team shows initiative and leadership potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Weaknesses:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Poor Formatting and Organization:**  The provided \"Resume Content\" section is messy and difficult to read. The use of symbols (�, ∠) instead of standard formatting is unprofessional and confusing. The sections are poorly delineated, and the flow of information is disjointed.  This significantly detracts from the positive aspects of the resume.\n",
      "* **Lack of Quantifiable Results:** While the projects are listed, there's no information on their impact or outcomes.  For example, instead of \"Developed an e-commerce website,\" she could say \"Developed an e-commerce website that increased sales by X%.\" Quantifiable results make the achievements more impactful.\n",
      "* **Vague Descriptions:**  Project descriptions are too brief and lack context.  For instance, \"Implemented an image captioning model\" doesn't explain the challenges faced, the specific approach taken, or the accuracy achieved.  More detail is needed to showcase her skills and understanding.\n",
      "* **Inconsistent Project Information:** Some projects have detailed technology lists, while others don't.  This inconsistency makes the resume appear less polished.  The repetition of \"Next.js TailwindCSS MongoDB\" seems like a formatting error and needs correction.\n",
      "* **Underutilized Experience Section:**  \"App Development Lead\" is a good start, but the resume lacks details about the role's responsibilities, achievements, and the size of the team led.  Expanding on this experience would significantly strengthen the resume.\n",
      "* **Unnecessary Information:** Including 10th-grade education is unnecessary, especially given her strong college performance.  \"Can Speak English, Hindi, Odia\" is also generally implied unless a specific language proficiency is required for the job.  The \"Extras\" section seems misplaced and adds to the confusion.\n",
      "* **Contact Information Formatting:** The contact information is spread out and inconsistently formatted.  It should be grouped together clearly at the top or bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Revamp Formatting:**  Use a clean, professional template.  Clearly separate sections with headings and use bullet points effectively.  Eliminate the symbols and ensure consistent formatting.\n",
      "* **Quantify Achievements:**  Add metrics to demonstrate the impact of her projects.  For example, mention user growth for SocialFair, sales figures for Radon, or performance metrics for the deep learning models.\n",
      "* **Elaborate on Project Descriptions:** Provide more context about the projects. Explain the challenges, the solutions implemented, and the results achieved. Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure these descriptions.\n",
      "* **Expand on Experience:** Provide details about her leadership role, including responsibilities, team size, and achievements.\n",
      "* **Refine Skills Section:** While a broad skill set is good, consider tailoring it slightly based on the specific jobs she's applying for.\n",
      "* **Remove Redundant Information:**  Remove 10th-grade education and the generic language proficiency.  Consolidate and streamline the contact information.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "By addressing these weaknesses, Angelina can significantly improve her resume's clarity, impact, and professionalism, ultimately increasing her chances of landing desired opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Resume Weaknesses ---\n",
      " Angelina's resume has potential, but it needs significant restructuring and refining to effectively communicate her skills and experience. Here's a breakdown of the weaknesses and suggested improvements:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Weaknesses:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Unprofessional Formatting:** The use of symbols like � and ∠ is distracting and unprofessional.  The formatting is inconsistent and difficult to read.  The single, long paragraph for the \"Work Experience and Projects\" section is confusing.\n",
      "* **Lack of Quantification:**  The projects list what she *did*, but not the *impact*.  For instance, how accurate was the image captioning model?  How did AlgoVisualiser improve learning for users? Did SocialFair gain any traction?\n",
      "* **Vague Experience Description:**  \"App Development Lead\" needs more detail.  What apps were developed?  What were her responsibilities? How large was the team?\n",
      "* **Unnecessary Information:**  Listing 10th and 12th-grade details is unnecessary for a 4th-year university student.  \"Can Speak English, Hindi, Odia\" is assumed unless the job requires specific language proficiency.\n",
      "* **Keyword Stuffing:** The skills section appears to list everything she's ever touched.  This dilutes the impact and makes it harder for recruiters to identify her core strengths.  Focus on the skills most relevant to the target roles.\n",
      "* **Inconsistent and Confusing Project Descriptions:** The repeated listing of technologies under each project (e.g., \"Next.js TailwindCSS MongoDB Express Socket.io\") appears randomly and adds no value.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Suggested Improvements:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Professional Formatting:**  Use a standard resume template.  Use clear headings, bullet points, and concise language. Remove symbols.  Maintain consistent font and spacing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Quantify Achievements:**  Add measurable results to projects.  Examples:\n",
      "    * **Image Captioning:**  \"Achieved X% accuracy on the benchmark dataset Y, outperforming the baseline model by Z%.\"\n",
      "    * **AlgoVisualiser:**  \"Developed a web application used by X students, with Y% reporting improved understanding of algorithms.\"\n",
      "    * **Radon:**  \"Implemented Stripe integration, resulting in a X% increase in successful transactions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Detailed Experience:**  Expand on the leadership role:\n",
      "    * **App Development Lead:** \"Led a team of X students in the development of Y apps for Z platform, including [app name 1] which achieved [result] and [app name 2] which [result].\"  Describe specific responsibilities like project planning, code reviews, delegation, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Focus on Relevant Skills:** Tailor the skills section to the specific job being applied for.  Prioritize the most important skills and group them logically (e.g., Frontend Development, Backend Development, Databases, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Restructure Project Descriptions:**  Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to describe projects.  Clearly state the project's purpose, the challenges faced, the actions taken, and the outcomes achieved.  Remove the redundant technology lists under each project; these are already covered in the skills section.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Refine Education:**  Remove 10th and 12th-grade details.  Focus on the B.Tech degree, including expected graduation date and CGPA.  Consider adding relevant coursework (e.g., Data Structures and Algorithms, Machine Learning, Web Development).\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Strong Summary/Objective:**  Start with a compelling summary or objective statement that highlights Angelina's key skills and career goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Professional Contact Information:**  Use a professional email address.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "By implementing these improvements, Angelina can create a much stronger resume that effectively showcases her abilities and increases her chances of landing interviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Job Title Suggestions ---\n",
      " Given Angelina's skills and project portfolio, here are some job roles she can apply for on LinkedIn:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Focusing on Web Development:**\n",
